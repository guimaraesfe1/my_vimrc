remember, when using this file, change the name to be detected when vim starts:

Unix            $HOME/.vimrc or $HOME/.vim/vimrc
MS-Windows      $HOME/_vimrc, $HOME/vimfiles/vimrc or $VIM/_vimrc
Amiga           s:.vimrc, home:.vimrc, home:vimfiles:vimrc or $VIM/.vimrc
Haiku           $HOME/config/settings/vim/vimrc

If Vim was started with "-u filename", the "filename" is used.
For more information type ":help vimrc" on normal mode of your vim.
